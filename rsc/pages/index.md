Welcome -

This is where all LC101 challenge problems will reside (for the O'Fallon 2018 group, anyways). Links to the individual challenges are on the left. Let me know if the web page is buggy, the colors irritate you, or you have any other questions - it was built hastily so I would anticipate some.

Below is a sample code snippet:

${hello_world.py}

This code isn't fancy and interactive like the online textbook, it's just nicely formatted html. It should support easy copying/pasting - let me know if you have trouble with this.
