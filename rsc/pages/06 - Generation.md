#Procedural Generation

Procedural generation is a pretty vague term that means creating data algorithmically (step-by-step). This is in contrast to creating the data manually. I don't really know if this has real-world applicability but I think it's pretty neat. So that's what this challenge is about.

Procedural generation can use any technique and can apply to any data type. So the range of application is pretty bonkers. An example would be the problem input from the regular expression challenge. I didn't type all of that out - I created a program that generated it for me.

${gen_mine.py}

But one could also procedurally generate images, music, voices, data-sets - anything. It's an incredibly powerful concept, but it requires some creativity to be used effectively.

A simple example technique that one might find useful for the purposes of this challenge is midpoint displacement. It consists of taking a line (or other pair of quantifiable entities), finding the mid-point, and then shifting that midpoint by some (usually random) amount.

For the challenge, you must procedurally generate illustrations of beautiful mountain scenery using turtles (really use whatever library you want, graphics libraries would be easier but you have to learn them so..). If it's not beautiful, it doesn't count. Post pics in [#challenge](slack://channel?team=TDSBUVC57&id=CDW9J3STS) channel, vote using emojis or w/e. Bonus points for using algorithms other than midpoint displacement.
