Chapter 11 introduces dictionaries and how they may be used - but it doesn't explain how they work under the hood. What Python calls a dictionary is typically referred to as a **hashtable** or **hashmap** - named such because their implementations are dependent on hashing the input or **key** and using the resulting hash to index the **value**. What does it mean to "hash the input", though?
