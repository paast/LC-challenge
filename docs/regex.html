<p>A regular expression (regex) is a wonky-looking series of characters that form a pattern. This pattern can then be used to search a string for matches. Regular expressions are not unique to Python and, regardless of which language you're using regular expressions in, the expressions are going to be (nearly) identical - so I think it's best to regard regular expressions as a separate mini-language. A regex might look something like <code>\w*</code> or <code>regex</code> or even <code>#(\d+)\ @\ (\d+),(\d+):\ (\d+)x(\d+)</code>. They can look spooky - and some of them really are - but each regex can be broken down into meaningful units which are easy to understand.</p>
<p>Now before we get too far into how regular expressions work and how to interpret/create them, it's worth looking at <em>why</em> we might want to use such a complex-seeming string parsing tool in the first place. Let us look at a few common string manipulations and their limitations:</p>

<p>With <code>string_1</code> and <code>string_2</code>, if we want to get rid of non-alphabetic characters to create <code>abcdefghij</code> - we can accomplish this with the basic string operation <code>.replace()</code>. But what about <code>string_3</code> where there are multiple non-alphabetic characters? We could chain together multiple <code>.replace()</code>s or use a for-loop to check each and every character but with more complex operations this route quickly becomes cumbersome. And what about <code>string_4</code>? It's a <code>[year-month-day hour:minute]</code> timestamp. It wouldn't be too unreasonable to parse it using string slices (<code>[:]</code>) - but what if this timestamp is arbitrarily positioned amongst other characters? The problem becomes much more messy. It is worth noting that I say messy and not impossible. Regular expression are not introducing some new and magical capability - they just make certain string-related problems much more manageable.</p>

<p>Here I'm showing the two main uses I have found for regular expressions - though I'm sure there are many more: the ability to match variable expressions and the ability to extract groups from within a matched pattern. I'm going to link the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">re Python documentation</a> and encourage you all to find external videos or websites which will do the topic much greater justice than I could (as it is a pretty complex subject) - but I'll give a brief explanation of these two concepts and, generally, how regular expressions are implemented in Python. Also, here's a <a href="https://regex101.com/">neat site</a> for building and testing regular expressions.</p>
<p>First, I'll start off by saying that in python, regular expressions are just strings. You'll see me using the <code>r"&lt;string&gt;"</code> format, but this is still a string - just a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals">raw string</a>. Raw strings differ from normal strings in that the backslash <code>\</code> character which is escape character in a regular string has no special significance to Python. This is useful because regular expression strings are parsed twice - first by Python and then by the regex engine - and the backslash is an escape character in both parsers. So we'd have to use <code>\\</code> in order to get a backslash to show up to in the regex - point is, it gets confusing if you don't use raw strings to represent regular expressions.</p>
<p>Moving on to the first example, we define our regex pattern as <code>r"\d+"</code>. <code>\d</code> matches any sequence of digits [0-9] and the <code>+</code> matches 1 or more of the preceding pattern. So we end up matching any occurrence of one or more digits. Using <code>re.sub()</code>, we substitute all occurrences of this pattern for a blank string (effectively removing them).</p>
<p>In the second example, we define our regex pattern as <code>r"\[(\d+-\d+-\d+)\ (\d+:\d+)\]"</code>. In a regex, parentheses <code>()</code> are used to denote a group. Groups may be referenced individually once a match is found as I'll show in a moment - but for now, lets break that regex down: 1<code>\[</code> + 2<code>(\d+-\d+-\d+)</code> + 3<code>\</code> + 4<code>(\d+:\d+)</code> + 5<code>\]</code>. The <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> characters have special meaning in a regex, thus we must regex-escape them. Sub-pattern 1 <code>\[</code>, then, is a direct match for the <code>[</code> character. Same goes for 5, but with the <code>]</code> character. Sub-pattern 3 matches a space. Technically, I don't think spaces have to be escaped in a regex, but they can be and to me it makes it more visually obvious that there's a space there. Now, looking at sub-pattern 2, we can remove the parentheses and we get <code>\d+-\d+-\d+</code>. This looks familiar, right? We had a <code>\d+</code> in the first example. So this translates to one or more digits followed by a dash <code>-</code> followed by another sequence of one or more digits followed by another dash followed by a final sequence of one or more digits. Easy, right? Now sub-pattern 4 should make plenty of sense. We can then use this regex to find a match and get the groups from that match with <code>re.match().groups()</code>. Thus we are able to gather the <code>date</code> and <code>time</code> strings (our two groups).</p>
<p>This is a lot to absorb - especially considering that you'll need to do some external research on your own to get a better feeling for regular expressions. I'm going to encourage peer-driven effort more so than usual due to this - if you find a resource that was particularly helpful, share it with your classmates. We may end up taking multiple classes to go over this, if necessary.</p>
<div class="alert">Yo, also: <code>re.match()</code> only matches a single match and it always looks at the beginning of the string for the match. Use <code>re.search()</code> to find anywhere in the string, and <code>re.findall()</code> to find all matches in the string.</div>

<p>For the challenge problem, I've attached <a href="./assets/bonnie.txt" download>a plaintext file</a> which documents the adventures of a bee. The document is composed of many records with the format <code>[time]:&lt;x, y, z&gt;</code>, where <code>time</code> is in seconds from the start (increasing) and <code>distance</code> is the relative distance she traveled in that time (not distance from the origin). When I made the file everything seemed normal but my finger slipped when I uploaded it. I'm not quite sure what happened, but I'm sure you all are bright enough to figure it out. There are multiple parts to this challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming that Bonnie <em>(the bee, of course)</em> started at the coordinates <code>(0, 0, 0)</code> and at <code>time = 0</code> - find out the distance to where she ended up.</li>
<li>How long did it take her to reach that destination?  <ul>
<li>What was her average speed across the journey? (<code>speed = abs(total_distance_traveled) / total_time</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bonus: ¿?¿¿??¿,   ASCII char = 7 bits</li>
</ul>
